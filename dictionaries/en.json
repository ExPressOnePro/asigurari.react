        "longDescription": "OSAGO, or Compulsory Civil Liability Insurance, is a reliable form of protection when driving a car in Moldova. This insurance protects individuals affected in an accident caused by another party. In case of an incident, it helps cover medical expenses, car repairs, and other damages. OSAGO is a mandatory requirement for all drivers. Before operating a vehicle, make sure your policy is active. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in significant fines. When choosing an insurance company, it is important to evaluate not only the price of the policy. Key factors include the company's reputation, quality of service, and speed of payments. Choosing the right insurance company can prevent additional problems in the event of an accident and ensure that you and those affected receive the necessary support and compensation.",
